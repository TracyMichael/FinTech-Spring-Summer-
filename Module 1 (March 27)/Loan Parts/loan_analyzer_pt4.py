"""Part 4: Conditionally filter lists of loans.

In this section, you will use a loop to iterate through a series of loans and select only the inexpensive loans.

1. Create a new, empty list called `inexpensive_loans`.
2. Use a for loop to select each loan from a list of loans.
    a. Inside the for loop, write an if-statement to determine if the loan_price is less than or equal to 500
    b. If the loan_price is less than or equal to 500 then append that loan to the `inexpensive_loans` list.
3. Print the list of inexpensive_loans.
