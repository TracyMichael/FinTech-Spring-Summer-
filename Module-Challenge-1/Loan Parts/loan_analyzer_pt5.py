"""Part 5: Save the results.

Output this list of inexpensive loans to a csv file
    1. Use `with open` to open a new CSV file.
        a. Create a `csvwriter` using the `csv` library.
        b. Use the new csvwriter to write the header variable as the first row.
        c. Use a for loop to iterate through each loan in `inexpensive_loans`.
            i. Use the csvwriter to write the `loan.values()` to a row in the CSV file.

    Hint: Refer to the official documentation for the csv library.
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#writer-objects
